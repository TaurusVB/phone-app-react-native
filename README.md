## Technologies Used

PhotoMap is built with a stack of cutting-edge technologies:

- **React Native:** The core framework for building the mobile app, allowing us to create a seamless and native-like user experience.

- **Redux Toolkit:** For state management, enabling efficient data flow and synchronization in the app.

- **Firebase:** We rely on Firebase for real-time database capabilities, ensuring that your photos, likes, and comments stay up to date. Firebase also powers the user authentication system for a secure and reliable experience.

- **CSS:** Our styling and design are meticulously crafted with CSS to provide an attractive and intuitive interface.

These technologies come together to deliver a robust, feature-rich, and user-friendly application experience.
